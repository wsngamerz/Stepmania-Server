# Stepmania Server: A Stepmania Server

The plan for this project is to have a fully functioning stepmania server with an intergrated web client which can display live games and statistics to all players and all songs played.

The server at the moment aims to be compatible with all official builds of stepmania.

**Compatible Stepmania Versions:**
[StepMania 5.0.12](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/tag/v5.0.12),
[StepMania 5.1-beta](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/tag/v5.1.0-b2)

Unfortunatly the Alpha builds of SM5.3 are not compatible yet but when I can get my hands on the updated protocol documentation, the server will try to update to this.

Furthermore, older versions of stepmania and forks of stepmania may or may not work, they are untested.

The storage options will be initially either SQLite or MySQL but I aim to make this server as configurable as possible so more can be added if need be in the future.
