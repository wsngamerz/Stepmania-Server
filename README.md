# Stepmania Server: A Stepmania Server

The plan for this project is to have a fully functioning stepmania server with an intergrated web client which can display live games and statistics to all players and all songs played.

The server at the moment aims to be compatible with all official builds of stepmania.

The storage options will be initially either SQLite or MySQL but I aim to make this server as configurable as possible so more can be added if need be in the future.
